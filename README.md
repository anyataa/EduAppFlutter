# EduApp build with Flutter
### created by Anya Tamara Akbar

EduApp is an interactive learning application build based on the critical thinking aspects from Facione (1990) in ATC21S. EduApp consists of four main fitur including Games, Assignments, Lessons, and Feedbacks. Since the suggestion of creating more subjects not only limited in Pekerjaan Dasar Teknik Mesin (PDTM) then the urge of API services is needed. Without the API services, the further development for adding more subjects in SMK will cause the application size getting bigger which is not a very good option and not feasible for the student.
